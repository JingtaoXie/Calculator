This simple calculator was made by Zeyu(Jerry) Zhao and Jingtao(Toby) Xie. This programme aims to finish the following goals:
1. Give an accurate result for users
2. Use Tkinter to visualise, not only running the outcome on the console.
3. Combine local practice to make this calculator have more practical meaning (e.g., tax calculator)

Thank you for your viewing!
